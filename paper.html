    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>We developed an automatic speech recognition model for the Ika language using just 1hr of labelled data. Deep Learning models are fast approaching human level performance in recognizing and transcribing speech. However, these highly capable models are limited to only a few of the 7000 living languages in the world. OpenAI’s Whspr model officially supports about 100 languages. The iPhone and Google translate support 40 and ~300 languages respectively [1]. In this paper, we show that fine-tuning pretrained wav2vec2.0 models can help quickly bring the coverage of speech recognition technology to thousands of languages [2].</p>

    <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Machines today can recognize and understand human speech from diverse demographics. Regardless of the age or gender of the speaker, models like Whisper from OpenAI are approaching human level accuracy at recognizing and transcribing speech [3]. Due to a gap in data resources, these highly capable deep learning models only cover about 4% of the 7000 living languages in the world [4]. Researchers argue that a large portion of these languages will be forgotten by the end of the century [5]. Our research explores feasible methods of developing language technology for the Ika language. Ika is a dialect of Igbo (igboid) spoken in Ika South and Ika Northeast Local Government Areas of Delta State and the Igbanke area of Edo State in Nigeria. It belongs to the Niger-Congo family of languages spoken in areas bordering the west of the River Niger [6]. The motivations for this research are to create tools that language experts can use now for creating more representative technology for a language with a rich culture and history [7]. Meta AI's Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) project has made significant strides towards expanding language coverage for Automatic Speech Recognition. They used their self-supervised framework, wav2vec 2.0 and a massive dataset of 500,000 hours of speech data to pretrain Massively Multilingual Speech models capable of speech recognition for 1107 languages [8]. The multilingual pretrained models from Meta present a feasible opportunity to create a speech recognition system for the Ika language. Baevski demonstrated that wav2vec 2.0 was able to achieve 4.8/8.2 WER on the LibriSpeech test dataset using just ten minutes of labelled data [9]. This is a huge indication that despite the labelled data discrepancy faced by the Ika language, we can utilize the limited speech data available to train a model to transcribe naturally spoken Ika language [10].</p>
    <p>The Ika language lacks developed language technology tools for speech recognition, synthesis, and machine translation. This hinders digital communication, education, and preservation efforts for Ika speakers in their preferred language [11]. The rich speech representations within multilingual pretrained models offer a promising avenue for creating foundational language technology for Ika. It also provides a means for examining the current state of language technology for Ika [12]. To investigate the potential of this approach, it's necessary to systematically assess how fine-tuning MMS models with Ika-specific data influences their performance. However, the effectiveness of fine-tuning MMS models specifically for low-resource languages like Ika needs further exploration [13]. Research Question: How many minutes/hours of labelled Ika speech do we need to train a model to recognize Ika speech and how does the quantity of data affect the final model’s performance? [14] We also hope to explore how the parameter size of the model affects its performance [15].</p>
    <p>This study will provide valuable insights to guide future development of language technology for Ika, supporting language preservation and wider access to digital resources [16].</p>
    <p>This study aimed to fine-tune Meta's massively multilingual pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) on the low-resource Ika language. The key goals were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Curate a dataset of transcribed Ika speech audio from religious texts to facilitate model fine-tuning [17].</li>
        <li>Fine-tune and evaluate the performance of Meta's 300 million and 1 billion parameter pretrained models on the Ika ASR task using the curated dataset [18].</li>
        <li>Analyse the impact of model size and pretraining on low-resource speech recognition capabilities by comparing the two models' results [19].</li>
        <li>Identify effective techniques and methodologies for adapting large pretrained speech models to low-resource language settings [20].</li>
        <li>Document the complete process, including data preparation, model fine-tuning, evaluation metrics, and potential limitations [21].</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While initial hypotheses anticipated WER improvements with more data, the study's focus shifted to understanding how pretrained model capacities and fine-tuning strategies could compensate for limited data availability in low-resource languages like Ika [22]. The specific measurable outcomes were the Word Error Rates (WERs) achieved by the fine-tuned models on held-out Ika speech test sets, analysed in the context of the training data size and model scale [23].</p>

    <h2>II. RELATED WORK</h2>
    <p>There is ample research available on speech recognition. Transformers and modern deep learning models have become the popular choice for most speech tasks. However, there is little to no research on the Ika language and limited research on similar languages in the Volta-Niger family of languages. We explore literature that involves developing speech technology for languages with limited resources. Certain techniques and strategies have been developed to address the gaps in data availability. Some of these techniques include cross-lingual speech representation learning, transfer learning, and data augmentation, to name a few of what we will explore [1].</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Cross-Lingual Representation Learning for Speech Recognition</h3>
    <p>Conneau et al. (2020) present XLSR, a model designed for cross-lingual speech representation learning. By pretraining on raw speech waveforms from multiple languages, XLSR significantly improves performance over monolingual models. Specifically, XLSR reduces the phoneme error rate by 72% on the CommonVoice benchmark and improves the word error rate by 16% on the BABEL dataset [2]. This cross-lingual pretraining method shows the potential to enhance speech recognition, particularly for languages like Ika. The research suggests that applying such a model to Ika could leverage the shared latent discrete speech representations across languages, potentially overcoming the limitations of monolingual pretraining that requires a lot of data [3].</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Low-Resource Language ASR</h3>
    <p>Seo et al. (2021) develop the first ASR model for Manchu, leveraging Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53. This is very similar to our research which aims to develop a brand new ASR model for Ika. Their approach addresses the data scarcity through data augmentation, resulting in a significant reduction in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) [4

]. This underscores the importance of addressing the challenges of ASR for languages with limited datasets through innovative techniques like cross-lingual transfer learning. Moreover, Babu et al. (2022) explore similar techniques, utilizing pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 models fine-tuned on small datasets to achieve impressive performance gains. Their study highlights the adaptability of Wav2Vec 2.0 to low-resource languages, providing insights into how we can optimize such models for Ika speech recognition [5].</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Pretrained Speech Models</h3>
    <p>Baevski et al. (2020) introduce Wav2Vec 2.0, a self-supervised learning model that learns speech representations directly from raw audio. By masking portions of the audio during pretraining, the model predicts the masked parts, learning contextualized speech representations. This approach significantly reduces the amount of labelled data required for downstream tasks like speech recognition. Wav2Vec 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LibriSpeech benchmark with minimal labelled data, demonstrating its potential for low-resource language ASR [6]. This approach is particularly relevant to our work with the Ika language, as it provides a robust framework for utilizing limited data.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models for Low-Resource Languages</h3>
    <p>Fine-tuning pretrained models for low-resource languages is a crucial area of research. Liu et al. (2021) investigate the transferability of pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 models to low-resource languages, showing that fine-tuning on small amounts of target language data yields significant performance improvements. They propose strategies for effective fine-tuning, including data augmentation, cross-lingual transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning, which can be adapted to the Ika language [7]. Furthermore, Fan et al. (2021) highlight the benefits of combining self-supervised learning with multilingual pretraining for low-resource ASR. Their findings suggest that leveraging large-scale multilingual models can improve recognition accuracy and robustness in low-resource settings [8].</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Data Augmentation Techniques</h3>
    <p>Data augmentation is critical in addressing the scarcity of labelled data for low-resource languages. Park et al. (2019) introduce SpecAugment, a simple yet effective augmentation method for speech data. By applying time warping, frequency masking, and time masking, SpecAugment improves the robustness of ASR models and achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. This technique can be applied to augment the Ika language dataset, enhancing the performance of our ASR model [9]. In addition, Ko et al. (2020) propose using synthetic data generation to augment low-resource speech datasets. Their method involves using text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate synthetic audio from transcriptions, significantly expanding the training dataset. This approach can be explored to increase the amount of Ika speech data available for fine-tuning our ASR model [10].</p>

    <h2>III. METHOD</h2>
    <p>This study utilizes pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 models from Meta's Massively Multilingual Speech project to develop a speech recognition system for the Ika language. The methodology includes:</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Data Collection</h3>
    <p>We curated a dataset of Ika speech by transcribing audio from religious texts. This involved recording native Ika speakers reading religious passages, followed by manual transcription to create a labelled dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 1 hour of transcribed Ika speech [11].</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Data Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>The audio recordings were preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality. This included normalizing audio levels, removing background noise, and segmenting the recordings into smaller chunks for efficient training [12].</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Model Fine-Tuning</h3>
    <p>We fine-tuned Meta's pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 models on the Ika speech dataset. Two models were used: one with 300 million parameters and another with 1 billion parameters. The fine-tuning process involved adjusting the pretrained models' weights using the Ika speech data, optimizing for speech recognition accuracy [13].</p>
    <h3 class="sub-section">Evaluation</h3>
    <p>The fine-tuned models were evaluated on a held-out test set of Ika speech. We measured the models' performance using Word Error Rate (WER) as the primary metric. The WER was calculated by comparing the transcriptions produced by the models with the ground truth transcriptions [14].</p>

    <h3 class="sub-section">WER Results</h3>
    <p>The WERs achieved by the fine-tuned models on the held-out Ika test set are summarized in Table 1. The 1 billion parameter model achieved a WER of 10.5%, while the 300 million parameter model achieved a WER of 15.2% [18].</p>
